A **variable** is used to store values such as text or numbers. We have included some variables that store emoji characters.

--- task ---

Change your code to also `print()`{:.language-python} the contents of the `world`{:.language-python} variable. You can do this by adding the variable name in curly brackets `{}`{:.language-python}


--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 17
---
# Rhowch y cod i'w redeg o dan fan hyn
print(f'Hello {world}')

--- /code ---

The `f`{:.language-python} character inside the print lets you easily print variables along with strings of text.
