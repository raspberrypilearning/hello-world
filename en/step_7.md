## Upgrade your project

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Add more to your project. There are more emoji to choose from.
  </div>
<div>
![](images/image.png){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

You could:
+ Use `print` with different text and emoji
+ Get `input` into variables and then do sums
+ Write more functions to organise your code
+ Use `#` to add comments to your code

Click on `emoji.py` to see the emoji variables that you can use. Click back on `main.py` to add to your code.

Here's an example function that asks about hobbies:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---
# Put code to run under here
def hobbies():
  hobby = input('What do you like?')
  print('That sounds', fun)
  print('You could make a', python, 'project about', hobby)
--- /code ---

**Tip:** Don't forget you will need to call your function as well as defining it.
