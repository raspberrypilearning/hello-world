Here's an example function that asks about hobbies:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---

# Put code to run under here    
def hobbies():   
    hobby = input('What do you like?')   
    print('That sounds', fun)  # You will need to create an emoji variable called 'fun'
    print('You could make a', python, 'project about', hobby) 

--- /code ---

**Tip:** Don't forget you will need to call your function as well as define it.

You can use `input` to make your project wait for the user to tap <kbd>Enter</kbd> at any point in this project.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---

roll_dice()

input()  # Wait for the user to tap Enter

hobbies()  # Calls the hobbies function
