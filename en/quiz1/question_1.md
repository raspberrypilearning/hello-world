Which code correctly uses the `world` variable and outputs Hello 🌍🌎🌏?

 Not quite, `output` is not the way to output messages to the screen.

 Not quite, in Python `print` outputs messages to the screen, but something is missing in this example.

 That's correct, in Python `print` outputs messages to the screen. The text output is inside single quotes `'` , a comma separates the two items and provides a space, then the `world` variable is called, which stores the earth emoji 🌍🌎🌏, like in your project.
