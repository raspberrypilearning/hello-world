Type the code to `print()`{:.language-python} Hello to the screen:

--- code ---

line_highlights: 18
---
# Put code to run under here.
print(f'Hello')

A **variable** is used to store values such as text or numbers. We have included some variables that store emoji characters.

Change your code to also `print()`{:.language-python} the contents of the `world`{:.language-python} variable. You can do this by adding the variable name in curly brackets `{}`{:.language-python}


--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 17
---
# Βάλε κώδικα για εκτέλεση εδώ
print(f'Hello {world}')

--- /code ---

The `f`{:.language-python} character inside the print lets you easily print variables along with strings of text.
