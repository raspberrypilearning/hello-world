## Roll a dice 🎲

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Create a function for rolling a dice using random numbers. 
  
In Python:
  - **functions**, defined with `def`, are like 'my blocks' in Scratch,
  - `randint` is like 'random' in Scratch, and
  - `input` is like 'ask' in Scratch.

Στην Python **καλείς** μία **συνάρτηση()** για να εκτελέσεις μια ενέργεια. Έχεις ήδη χρησιμοποιήσει τη συνάρτηση `print()` για να εμφανίσεις κείμενο.

Μπορείς να **ορίσεις** μια νέα **συνάρτηση** για να ομαδοποιήσεις τον κώδικα ώστε να μπορείς να τον ονομάσεις και να τον επαναχρησιμοποιήσεις.

### Define your function

--- task ---

Οι συναρτήσεις πρέπει να οριστούν για να μπορέσεις να τις καλέσεις. Look for the comment in the **main.py** file that says `# Function definitions`.

Define a new function called `roll_dice()` that uses the `randint()` function from the `random` library, to generate a random 'integer' (whole number) from 1 to 6 and output it to the screen.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 16-17
---

# Function definitions
def roll_dice():  # Don't forget the colon at the end of this line   
print('You rolled a', randint(1, 6))  # randint(1, 6) is used to give a number between 1 and 6.

--- /code ---

The line under `def roll_dice():` is **indented**. Για να το κάνεις αυτό, χρησιμοποίσε τον χαρακτήρα <kbd>Tab</kbd> στο πληκτρολόγιό σου (συνήθως πάνω από το <kbd>CAPSLOCK</kbd> στο πληκτρολόγιο). Η τοποθέτηση του κώδικα σε εσοχή ενημερώνει την Python ότι οι γραμμές με την εσοχή αποτελούν μέρος της συνάρτησης.

**Tip:** The underscore `_` is used between words in variable and function names in Python to make them easier to read. Δεν μπορείς να χρησιμοποιήσεις το κενό χαρακτήρα γι' αυτές τις περιπτώσεις.

Σε ένα πληκτρολόγιο Η. Β. ή ΗΠΑ, η άνω και κάτω τελεία `:` βρίσκεται στο ίδιο πλήκτρο με το ερωτηματικό, δίπλα στο πλήκτρο <kbd>L</kbd>: κράτησε πατημένο το <kbd>Shift</kbd> και πάτησε <kbd>;</kbd> για να εμφανίσεις ένα `:`. Η κάτω παύλα `_` βρίσκεται στο ίδιο πλήκτρο με την `-`, δίπλα στο <kbd>0</kbd>, κράτησε πατημένο το <kbd>Shift</kbd> και πάτησε <kbd>-</kbd> για να εμφανίσεις `_`.

**Δοκιμή:** Εάν «τρέξεις» τον κώδικά σου τώρα, δεν θα ρίξει ζάρι. Αυτό οφείλεται στο γεγονός ότι έχεις ορίσει τη συνάρτησή `roll_dice()`, αλλά δεν την έχεις καλέσει ακόμα.

**Debug:**

- Make sure you have an underscore `_` between roll and dice to make the function name.

- Make sure you have a colon `:` at the end of the line.

- Check that the line under `def roll_dice()` is indented. It's really common to get this wrong in Python, so make sure to check.

![The code editor showing the line of code inside the <code>roll_dice</code> function has not been indented. The line of code with the error is highlighted. The code has been run, with the error 'SyntaxError: bad input on line 17 in main.py'.](images/indent_error.png)

### Call your function

--- task ---

To use a function, you need to **call** it in the code. Go to the end of your code and add a new line to call the `roll_dice()` function:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 25
line_highlights: 27
---

print('The date and time is', datetime.now())

roll_dice()  # Call the roll dice function

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project several times to see the random dice roll each time.

--- /task ---

Uses of random numbers include cryptography, data science, and adding variety into games and computer art. Computers generate <span style="color: #0faeb0">**random numbers**</span> using an algorithm. For numbers that are really random, you need an unpredictable input from the real world.
</p>

### Use 🔥🔥🔥 for the number rolled

--- task ---

Your function can use the 🔥 emoji variable. The code `print(fire * 3)` outputs three fire emojis '🔥🔥🔥'. You need to output the correct number of emojis to match the random number rolled by the dice.

Change your code to save the value returned by `randint()` in a variable called `roll`. Use that variable to print out the number rolled with the matching number of 🔥 emojis.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 17-18
---

# Function definitions
def roll_dice(): roll = randint(1, 6)  # Generate a random number between 1 and 6 and store it in the variable 'roll' print('You rolled a', roll, fire * roll)  # Repeat the fire emoji to match the random dice roll

--- /code ---

**Tip** You can use `star` or `heart` instead of `fire` if you prefer, by creating your own emoji variables.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Test your project a few times. Make sure you understand how the code works.

--- /task ---

### Choose the number of sides on the dice

Upgrade your dice so that the user can choose the maximum number.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Lots of games use many-sided dice. In the physical world, dice are made from regular geometric shapes. Common dice include D6, D12, and D20. On a computer, you can generate a <span style="color: #0faeb0">random</span> number to make a fair dice with any number of sides.</p>

--- task ---

The `input()` function asks the user a question and then returns their answer.

**Add** code to ask the user for the biggest number on their dice and then save the result in a variable called `max` and `print` the number chosen into the output area:

Change your `roll` variable code to use `max` as the maximum value for `randint` when it generates a random number.

When you get input from the user, Python treats it as text. But, `randint` needs an 'integer' (a positive whole number). The `int` function turns the user input into an integer.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 18-20
---

# Function definitions

def roll_dice():   
max = input('How many sides?:')  # Wait for input from the user    
print('That\'s a D', max)  # Use the number the user entered    
roll = randint(1, int(max))  # Use max to determine the number of sides the dice has print('You rolled a', roll, fire * roll)

--- /code ---

To print an apostrophe `'` in a word like `That's`, put a backslash `\` before it so Python knows it's part of the text.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project. When the program reaches the `input` line, it will wait for you to enter a response before continuing. Type your response and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, this will allow the program to collect your response. Try it again with a different `input` number.
