Add more to your project. There are more emojis to choose from.

You could:
+ Use `print` with different text and emojis
+ Use `input` to get values from the user and store them as variables, then do sums with the variables
+ Write more functions to organise your code
+ Use `#` to add comments to your code

Scroll to the **emoji** section in the code editor to see the emojis and example variables that you can use. Copy the ones you choose and save them to a variable or add them directly to your code.

**Tip:** To add emojis, find the comment # Emojis to copy and paste into your code. Copy the emojis you want to use then paste them into your code.

Here's an example function that asks about hobbies:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---

# Put code to run under here
def hobbies():   
hobby = input('What do you like?')   
print('That sounds', fun)  # You will need to create an emoji variable called 'fun' print('You could make a', python, 'project about', hobby)

--- /code ---

**Tip:** Don't forget you will need to call your function as well as define it.

You can use `input` to make your project wait for the user to tap <kbd>Enter</kbd> at any point in this project.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---

roll_dice()

input()  # Wait for the user to tap Enter

hobbies()  # Calls the hobbies function
